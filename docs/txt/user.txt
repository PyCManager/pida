========================
Requirements to run PIDA
========================

Because of the nature of PIDA there are a number of tools that may optionally
be used, but are not absolutely required. The list of requirements is
therefore split into absolute and relative requirements.

Absolute Requirements
=====================

**Python**
    Python is the programming language PIDA is written in. PIDA requires any
    version of Python greater than or equal to 2.4. Python is available from
    the `Python Web Site`_ or more likely packaged for your distribution. Most
    desktop Linuxes come with Python preinstalled.

**PyGTK**
    PyGTK are the Python bindings for the GTK toolkit. Note that you will also
    need to have GTK installed for them to work. These are available from the
    `PyGTK Web Site`_ and the `GTK Web Site`_ or more likely packaged by your
    Linux distribution.
