PIDA Handbook

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Please note here typo or documentation format rules that should be consistent
throughout the whole document.

- PIDA should always be written PIDA for now. A find and replace will change
   this if necessary.

- The attitude of the writer (using first person, using 'you' or 'the user' to
   speak about the reader...) should be consistent throughout the whole
   document. It is not decided what this attitude shall be yet.

- Anchors should be explicit and composed using the hierarchy of the document
   ie: services_project_manager for Project Manager title in Services.

PIDA is an IDE (integrated development environment). PIDA is different from other IDEs in that it will use the tools that are already available rather than attempting to reinvent each one. PIDA is written in Python with the PyGTK toolkit, and although it is designed to be used to program in any language, PIDA has fancy Python IDE features.

This document describes PIDA features and usage. It is aimed at providing help for new comers and advanced users. Developer documentation is available in other sources for those who want to hack PIDA.

CAUTION: Since PIDA is still being actively worked on, this manual is still incomplete and will grow with time.

[[introduction]]
Introduction
------------
There are many IDE around, and some are very good. But lots of them are also _closed_ in the sense that they are limited in terms of extensibility or communication with other tools. On the other hand, some of you may want to change your editor for anything else, even if you have to rely on external tools to complete its features.

PIDA was designed with these problems in mind. PIDA's _motto_ is to reuse the tools that proved to be useful and solid, and to provide the glue for them. PIDA is written in Python with *PyGTK*, is easily extensible through plug-ins and can embed any editor provided someone writes an adapter for it.

PIDA has a number of unique features, such as

- Embedding Vim, Emacs or any editor. 
footnote:[Of course, the editor has to provide a way to communicate with for external programs. *Moo*, *Scite*, and probably *GEdit* could be candidates]
- Using any version control system.

[[installation]]
Installation
------------
PIDA is still not considered finalised by its authors. The most recent version lies in SVN repository, but milestones are available though to provide a snapshot of the development to the less adventurers.

[[installation_compilation]]
Compilation from sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The current development version is hosted on Google Code Subversion repository. You can use the following command to anonymously check the latest source code.
-------------------------------------------------------
svn checkout http://pida.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pida
-------------------------------------------------------

PIDA can be executed from its source directory. FIXME.

[[installation_packages]]
Distribution packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Though there is still a long way before PIDA can be considered mature, it is already packaged by several Linux and BSD(FIXME?) distributions. Use the guidelines of your distribution to install or remove PIDA from your system.

.Known distributions to provide PIDA
`-------------`----------------------`-----------
Distribution   Distribution version  PIDA version
-------------------------------------------------
Debian         Etch (_stable_)       0.3.1
Debian         Lenny (_testing_)     0.4.4
Debian         Sid (_unstable_)      0.4.4
Gentoo         FIXME.                FIXME.
Ubuntu         Breezy Badger         0.2.2
Ubuntu         Dapper Drake          0.2.2
Ubuntu         Edgy Eft              0.3.1
Ubuntu         Feisty Fawn           0.3.1
Ubuntu         Gutsy                 0.4.4
-------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: There are chances that the version packaged is a bit outdated. Please consider trying to install the most recent version before reporting a bug. You can either compile pida from sources or try to use a package prepared for a more recent version of your distribution.

[[getting_started]]
Getting started
---------------
FIXME.

[[getting_started_wizard]]
First run wizard 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: This feature is planned for a future version of PIDA, which is still undetermined yet.

[[getting_started_window]]
The PIDA window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Like any other IDE, PIDA provides in one window all the tools you need to edit your files, compile your programs, invoke external tools, explore a project space or a file hierarchy, and so on. The PIDA window is organized with a menu, a toolbar, multiple views and a status bar. Many of these elements are optional and can be hidden or displayed at will.

The menu bar
^^^^^^^^^^^^
*File*::
This menu offers all file related operations, like creating, saving, or closing a document, but also all version control operations. PIDA also provides sessions management, and the *File* menu permits to save the current session or load a previous one.

*Edit*::
This menu serves two purposes. First, it provides facilities to search documents throughout a project, or directories. But PIDA preferences and shortcuts settings are also modifiable from here.

*Project*::
This menu provides version control at project level. From there, it is also possible to modify the properties of a project and to start the configured controllers.
 
*Tools*::
Additional utilities, like a terminal and a Python shell for PIDA introspection.

*View*::
The PIDA window can be customized from there, displaying or hiding special views or elements like the menu bar or the tool bar. This menu also provides shortcuts to access quickly the most important views of the window, like the file manager.

*Help*::
Provides only the credits window for now.

The status bar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The status bar provides live information on

- The current project.
- The current directory browsed in the file manager.
- Information on t file currently edited, like its name, encoding and size.

The editor
^^^^^^^^^^
The editor is the core element of PIDA. All other views only provide utilities to fill the missing features of the editor, or integrate important accessories -- like a debugger -- or give a quick access to external tools -- like a terminal. The editor is also the central view of PIDA. All other views can be moved around it (see xref:getting_started_window_views[See Views]).

PIDA can support any editor. Editor shortcuts and features directly depend on what editor you prefer. It is possible that some features of the chosen editor and PIDA features overlap. In this case, both can be used, but the feature implemented by PIDA will certainly provide better integration with the other tools of the IDE.

[[getting_started_window_views]]
Views
^^^^^
All elements in the PIDA window, except the editor, the menu bar, the toolbar and status bar, can be moved (remember that the menu bar and the toolbar can be hidden though).

FIXME: must choose carefully the vocabulary for elements of the views and keep them consistent.
