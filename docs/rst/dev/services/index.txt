PIDA Service Authoring Guide
============================

PIDA has a very general concept of services (you might call them plugins in
another application). In general, a service is able to define any PIDA
function, that is anything PIDA can do, a service can do it too.

PIDA is essentially a bunch of services bound together by a **Boss**. The
services are discovered from service directories and loaded by a **Service
Manager** for the Boss.
