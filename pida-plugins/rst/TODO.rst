TODO, roughly in order of priority
==================================

Must Have
---------

* GUI for setting configurations

Nice to Have
------------

* tests!!
* Expand the outliner per default (option)
* catch Sphinx errors/warnings that are not included in the doctree
  parse_messages
* Option to have the *full* Sphinx hierarchy in the outliner (not only the
  current document)
* Maybe an option to hide a certain number of levels in the outliner. Both for
  upper level as for leaves
* Performance improvements (doctree caching!)

Known Bugs
----------

* Headings with "&" in it do not work! They show up in the outliner with the
  same name than the previous heading
